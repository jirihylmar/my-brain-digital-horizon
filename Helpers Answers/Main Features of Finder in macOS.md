## Efficiency Tips

1. Use a combination of views (Icons, List, Columns, Gallery) depending on the type of work you are doing.
2. Customize your sidebar by adding your most frequently used folders to the Favorites section.
3. Use color tags for visual sorting of files by priority or category.
4. For quick navigation, use the Path Bar (View → Show Path Bar).
5. Learn to use advanced search options with operators like "kind:", "date:", "name:", etc.

If you get lost, the safe way is to use the built-in help. `Command+Shift+/` is a universal Mac shortcut that opens the help for the application, where you can search for any command with a display of its location.
